# hierchymemory
A small test repository that will simulate the hierarchical temporal memory based cortical learning algorithm from Jeff Hawkins. 

The purpose of the project is to help in learning how HTM works and to test new functionality in a simple and platform-friendly way using MATLAB. The program is based off of the White Paper from Numenta, like many others. Detailed notes on the functionality of the HTM CLA will eventually be formatted and uploaded as well. These explanations will greatly improve upon those given in the White Paper (2011). 

It's the project that will change the way we think about machine intelligence. 

Further plans include implementing the entirety of the algorithm, as it is currently only the support modules, then implementing further the concepts of region hierarchy and beyond. My project is in its infancy and has no special significance to the world of HTM, but I hope to further expose the niceness/goodness (in technical speak) of the algorithm.
